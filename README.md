# Animal-Classification
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. It trains on a dataset, then evaluates its performance using validation data. The model achieves image classification based on features learned through layers like convolution, pooling, and dense connections.
