# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images and evaluated using separate validation data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory structure (`test_set` and `training_set` directories).
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `Cat_vs_Dog_Classifier.ipynb`.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images.

## Credits
- Dataset: [Kaggle - Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
- Inspiration: Inspired by various tutorials and guides on image classification with CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras.
